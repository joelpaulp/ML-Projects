Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Overview:**
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. I used the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle and explored various supervised learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to build an accurate prediction model.

**Key Highlights:**
- Achieved an accuracy of 75% on the test set.
- Performed data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and engineering new features.
- Compared the performance of different machine learning models and selected the best-performing one.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
